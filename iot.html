                <p>The course provides a basic understanding of the Internet of Things and allows the student to
                    understand key principles in the design, development and deployment of Internet of Things systems.
                    The course covers computing, sensing, networking, data management, security and privacy issues
                    surrounding smart devices and helps the student to understand how these relate to each other and
                    provide a “global platform for advanced services of the ICT era”. After the course the student will
                    be able to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Understand what the Internet of Things is and what makes it unique compared to other computing
